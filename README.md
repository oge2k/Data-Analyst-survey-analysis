# Data-Analyst-survey-analysis

## INTRODUCTION
I am doing this analysis for experience gain and to improve my skills and also for writing an analysis presentation

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Kaggle is a site for data analyst it allows people to upload data sets and allows others to download they also host competitions on who can tell a story through their analysis
so they also collect their won data through survey the people who use the site and these data can also be used to further understand the data landscape
i will be using the dataset i got to show the following
- size of the company most workers work for
- jobs that responders partake in
- level in their jobs
## DATA SOURCING

## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
For this project i used 

1. Microsoft excel: To clean the data for visualization 
2. Power BI: To visulize the data
### Data Cleaning
The data when sourced contained a lot of short form in the experience level, employment type and company level. these where replaced by the expanded word form.
There was a salary column which was removed to use the more standard column which converted all the salary to USD equivalent.
blank spaces in job category and in company level was replaced by not stated

## ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION
> size of company that most people work for

from my analysis and visualization we can see that most responses say they work for medium and small scale companies
